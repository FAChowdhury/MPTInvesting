# MPTInvesting
Investing capital in a portfolio consisting of securities listed on the Tokyo Stock Exchange (TSE) using Nikkei 225 Index as a benchmark, and conducting analysis around the philosophy of Harry Markowitz's mean-variance theory.

Please view the specification.

The 'MPT Investing.xlsx' file contains the Markowitz portfolio theory analysis.

'MPT Report.pdf' contains the justification of the selection of the 25 stocks from the TSE and the 5 stocks from the Ho Chi Minh Stock Exchange (HOSE). Furthermore, it contains the summary of key findings in the analysis which involve: **expanding the portfolio to global markets to reduce risk**, **how restrictions and constraints on the portfolio result in suboptimal minimum variance frontier**, and **the importance of diversification in reducing unsystematic risk**.
